<h2>What is yown?</h2>
yown (short for you own) is an android app to help you declutter and keep track
of your inventory.
<h2>What features are supported?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NFC functionality for updating items</li>
    <li>A SQLite DB for persistent storage</li>
    <li>Suggestions for what to keep and what to let go</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I reset the app?</h2>
You can reset all entries in the app in the settings activity. <code>Choose Settings > RESET ALL
    DATA</code>
<h2>Do I need to have NFC enabled?</h2>
No, it's not necessary to have NFC enabled. But I highly recommend it, as it
will make decluttering much easier. You can enable NFC in <code>Android > Settings > NFC</code>
<h2>How do I update existing items?</h2>
You can update items by clicking on them in the Main screen.
<h2>How do I update the NFC tag</h2>
Updating the NFC tag is not possible. The relationship between an item and the NFC tag is lifelong.
If you want
to update the NFC tag just delete the existing item and create a new one.
